This To-Do List Application is a simple yet functional web app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was built to sharpen my front-end development skills by creating a real-world tool that allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively.

The application enables users to add, complete, and delete tasks with ease. It also stores tasks locally in the browser, ensuring persistence across sessions.
